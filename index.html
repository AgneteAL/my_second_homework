          Film noir is a stylized genre of film marked by pessimism, fatalism, and cynicism. The term was originally used in France after WWII,
          to describe American thriller or detective films in the 1940s and 50s. Though, Hollywood’s film noir stretches back 
          to the 1920s. Film noir literally translates to “black cinema” and French critics 
          used it to describe Hollywood movies that were saturated with darkness and pessimism not seen before.

          It’s hard to say if it's is a genre or style, and the elements of noir listed below do not all have to be present for the film to be considered noir. 
          But they are extremely common with this style.

        <h2>Flashbacks</h2>

        <p>
          In film noir, the protagonist often narrates over flashbacks, revealing information to the audience and providing context or perspective. 
          Flashbacks also help ramp up tension and suspense by taking the audience through the events leading up to the movie’s premise, 
          revealing details that are helpful for understanding the plot 
          (since most noirs that have intricate, convoluted storylines).

        <h2>Characters</h2>

        <p>
          The standard film noir protagonist is a private eye or detective, whose persona often has shades of grey, 
          such as a dark past or moral ambiguity. Another standard character is the femme fatale: a desirable, 
          aggressive woman with suspicious or uncertain loyalties. Film noir movies are often filled supporting characters 
          who exist on the moral fringes of society, such as gangsters, 
          gamblers, boxers, and nightclub performers.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Neo-Noir/Modern Film Noir</h2>

        <p>
          The golden age of film noir is over, but its influences are still present in modern cinema, hence the rise of "neo-noir." The newer films 
          don't have to go by the same rules, since the Production Code ended in 1968. A film that's considered "neo-noir" can be characterized by the same elements 
          found in the older films, such as femme fatales, anti-heroes, and complex storylines. Plots also involved mystery and crime, but not exclusively. A modern noir movie doesn't have to be about a detective trying
          to solve a murder, or a private eye getting mixed up with a woman who murdered her husband.
